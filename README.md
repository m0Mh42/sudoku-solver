# Sudoku Solver

An app written in C to solve custom sudoku tables.
Sudoku tables passed to the executable file must be plain numbers.
Script reads the first 81 numbers of the tablefile (9*9) and tries to solve the table.

Usage:
```shell
sudoku.out [tablefile]
```

It's really simple tho, it's not gonna do much complicated stuff. I haven't written the **Table Creator** tho (yet).
